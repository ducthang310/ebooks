# EBooks
## Intro
This is a small website made with VueJs + Bootstrap 4.
It's used to sharing free eBooks. It's like a small online shop, but you don't need to pay (unless you like).
To get shareable download links, you need to
- do nothing    :))
- or pay money    :v  (wtf, it's free...)
- or like my pages    (y)   (thank you so much!!)

^_^ 

You can try it in [here](http://ebooks.shiroad.com/)


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
